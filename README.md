# wearher_app
A simple app showing the weather, my first time using an API
Used modules: express, body-parser

To use this app yourself you need to get an api key for openweather, add it to 
your environmental variables under the name: "OPENWEATHER_API_KEY" than you can
proceed as usual with a node application.
